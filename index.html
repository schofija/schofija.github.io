        <p>
            Hi! I'm Jack. I recently graduated from Oregon State University with a B.S. in Computer Science. This website showcases some of my favorite projects (both personal and school-related) I've worked on over the years.
        </p>

        <p> Still a WIP and will be updated frequently :) </p>
