	 1. On Ubuntu 20.04 and up, OBS Studio can be found on the Ubuntu Software application
	 </div>
	
  </div>

  <div class="mySlides1">
    <img src="install/2.png"> </img>
	 <div class="text"> 
	 2. When we click on OBS Studio, we are shown a description and image of the application is shown.

  </div>
  
    <div class="mySlides1">
    <img src="install/3.png"> </img>
	<div class="text"> 
	 3. After the download and installation is finished, OBS Studio can be found by pressing the "Show Applications" button (3x3 grid on bottom-left of screen).
		This means the Ubuntu Software application was able to successfully install OBS Studio.

	</div>
  
    <div class="mySlides1">
    <img src="install/4.png"> </img>
	<div class="text"> 
	4. When OBS Studio is launched for the first time, the application successfully opens.
		A popup also appears asking us if we want to reset the UI. 
		As this is the first time OBS has been opened, there is no reason for this popup to appear, 
		and is worth noting as an issue. 
		I clicked Yes to reset the UI

    <div class="mySlides1">
    <img src="install/5.png"> </img>

	 5. After "resetting" the UI, an "Auto-Configuration Wizard" appears. 
	 I left this on the default setting (Optimize for streaming).

<h2> Results and Findings: </h2>
<p> OBS Studio is straightfoward to install on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, requiring no advanced technical knowledge to do so. </p>
<p>	However, the initial configuration was not without the following usability issues: </p>
<ul>
	<li> The user was prompted to reset the UI upon the first startup. There is nothing to reset at this point. </li>
	<li> The user was unable to connect their twitch account to OBS, and had to use a stream key to authenticate instead. </li>
</ul>

<button onclick="toggleview2()"> Usability Testing (click to expand) </button>
<div id="toggleview2" style="display:none">
	<h2> Usability Testing: </h2>
	
	<p> First, we will test OBS's ability to find sources and add them to the capture. To do this
		we will run the following tests: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Capture the user's desktop. </li>
		<li> Capture a specified window on the user's desktop </li>
		<li> Capture webcam footage </li>
		<li> Add an image overlay to the recording </li>
		<li> Add a video overlay to the recording </li>
		<li> Add a text overlay to the recording </li>
		<li> Read text from a file and have it overlay the recording </li>
		<li> Capture audio from the user's desktop (INC) </li>
		<li> Capture microphone audio (INC) </li>
	</ul>
	<div style="display:none">
	<p> Next, we will tests OBS's streaming and recording capabilities: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Stream to Twitch.tv </li>
		<li> Record and save videos onto the user's hard drive </li>
		<li> Change recording resolution </li>
		<li> Change recording framerate </li>
		<li> Change recording bitrate </li>
		<li> Change audio bitrate </li>
		<li> Have seperate quality settings for streaming and recording </li>
		<li> See capturing statistics </li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p> When going through these tests, we will be considering the following questions: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Is the user able to complete the task? </li>
		<li> How long does it take for the user to complete the task? </li>
		<li> Is the user satisfied with the product's ability to do the task? </li>
		<li> What improvements could be made to benefit performance/user experience? </li>
	</ul>

	<p> OBS comes with a barebones configuration, and we must set up basic docks before we can do anything as a user. The following video demonstrates how to do so: </p>
	<video width="1280" height="720" controls>
		<source src="testing/1-docks.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag...
	</video>
	<p> The user is able to complete this task with zero hiccups. However, if the user is not already familiar with OBS, this task could take time to do. This could be a 
		potential source of frusturation with the user, as the application (by default) is essentially just a black screen with no options. I do not believe this is
		good product design, as (just about) every user will be using these docks to configure their capturing. To improve the usability of OBS, I would suggest having
		these docks enabled by default.
	</p>
	<h3> Capturing the user's desktop: </h3>
	<p> Within the sources dock, the user is able to click the "+" button to add a source. Upon pressing this button, a large array of sources pops up. From the popup, we
		will select Screen Capture (XSHM). Then, the following popup will appear:
	</p>
		<img src="testing/2.png"> </img>
	<p> As we do not have any existing sources to choose from, we will use the default "Create new" option. The "Make source visible" checkmark is enabled by default, and
		we will leave it enabled. Upon pressing "Ok", the popup closes, and another popup opens:  </p>
		<img src="testing/3.png"> </img>
	<p> OBS Studio by default is able to detect our desktop. As the laptop this is tested on has no secondary screens, the "Screens" dropdown menu only has the one option
		already selected. "Capture cursor" is checked by default, and "Advanced Settings" is left unchecked. All cropping options are set to 0 by default. If the user
		desires to crop the capture of the screen, they are able to input numbers into these fields. These numbers will crop the screen by the specified amount of pixels
		from that direction. In the following test, I am able to successfully crop the capture to only show the clock at the top-center of GNOME: </p>
		<img src="testing/4.png"> </img>
	<p> Upon checking "Advanced Settings", only one more option pops up: </p>
		<img src="testing/5.png">  </img>
	<p> Our user has no use for the X server option, so we will not be testing this setting. </p>
	<p> Once we hit "Ok", the popup closes, and we return to the main OBS application: </p>
		<img src="testing/6.png"> </img>
	<p> As our cropped capture is rather small, it only takes up a corner of the screen. We are able to use the red borders to drag and resize the capture, like so: </p>
			<video width="1280" height="720" controls>
		<source src="testing/resize.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag...
	</video>
	<p> Our source is now added to the sources list in the bottom-left dock. If we double-click on our source, we are able to reset the cropping back to zero. Note that doing
		this does not override the manual scaling we did in the video above, so we must scale it back after pressing "Ok", or else we just have a zoomed in view of the desktop: </p>
	<img src="testing/7.png"> </img>
	<p> After about 15-20 seconds of manually rescaling it to fit the capture, we are left with this: </p>
		<img src="testing/8.png">
	<p> Overall, the user was able to easily complete the task. It did not take long for the user to set up a desktop capture, and OBS makes it extremely intuitive to do so. The only
		hiccup seemed to be the lack of a "reset scaling" button (in an easy to find place, at least), as it took about 20 seconds to accomplish what could be done in a single button click,
		if that button was placed in an easy to find location. </p>
		
	<h3> Capture a specified window on the user's desktop </h3>
	<p> We use the same method to add a source as used before. This time we select "Window Capture (Xcomposite)" and the following popup shows: </p>
		<img src="testing/9.png"> </img>
	<p> We press "Ok", and are sent to the configuration menu: </p>
		<img src="testing/10.png"> </img>
	<p> Here, we are given a dropdown of all open windows on the system. In this case, the user chooses the select a notepad with the text "Hello World!" written on it.
		This configuration menu is very similar to that of the Desktop Capture. 
		There are some additional options, but these are not very useful to our user. </p>
		<img src="testing/12.png"> </img>
	<p> Upon exiting the configuration, the window capture correctly shows on OBS: </p>
		<img src="testing/14.png"> </img>
	
	<h3> Capture webcam footage </h3>
	<p> Using the same method as before, we add a new source. This time we select "Video Capture Device (V4L2)": </p>
	<img src="testing/15.png"> </img>
	<p> OBS is able to automatically detect our webcam and show live footage! </p>
	<img src="testing/16.png"> </img>
	<p> There are some options to manipulate the image displayed on the camera. The sliders appear to be functional, and changes to them appear in the preview: </p>
	<img src="testing/18.png"> </img>
	<p> Once the configuration menu is closed, our webcam footage correctly shows on OBS: </p>
	<img src="testing/19.png"> </img>
	
	<h3> Add an image overlay to the recording </h3>
	<p> Using the same method as before, we add a new source. This time we select "Image": </p>
	<img src="testing/21.png"> </img>
	<p> Here, we are given an option to select an image file: </p>
	<img src="testing/22.png"> </img>
	<p> A popup appears that allows us to navigate our directories to select the image: </p>
	<img src="testing/23.png"> </img>
	<p> Once the image is selected and the configuration is exited, we are able to see our image on OBS. Note that this image is transparent,
	 and image transparency seems to be fully functional in OBS (although it is hard to tell from the screenshot below). </p>
	<img src="testing/25.png"> </img>
	<img src="testing/24.png"> </img>
	<h3> Add a GIF to the recording </h3>
	<p> The user is able to double-click the existing image element to re-open the configuration menu. They are able to select a different file, and in this case upload a cat gif: </p>
	<img src="testing/26.png">
	<p> GIF support appears to be fully functional in OBS. </p>
	
	<h3> Add a text overlay to the recording </h3>
	<p> There are two options for text sources in OBS-- "Text (FreeType 2)" and "Text (Pango)." In this case, the user chooses the first option to pop up (FreeType 2): </p>
	<img src="testing/27.png">
	<p> The configuration menu greets us with an empty preview and a text box. We are able to type text into the box, and the preview updates responsively: </p>
	<img src="testing/28.png">
	<img src="testing/29.png">
	<p> Upon exiting the configuration menu, everything appears to be working: </p>
	<img src="testing/30.png">
	<h3> Read text from a file and have it overlay the recording </h3>
	<p> The following video demonstrates the usability testing for reading text from a file. In this video, we attempt to read text from a file. We test to see if OBS is
		able to update the text on the recording when the contents of the file change. </p>
			<video width="1280" height="720" controls>
		<source src="testing/textfromfile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag...
	</video>
	<p> As this video demonstrates, reading from a file appears to be completely broken on the FreeType 2 based text source. Clicking the "read from file" check box does
		not seem to do anything. Users who would like to read text from a file must use the Pango option. For the user, it is not clear to them why there are two different
		source options that appear identical, except for this issue. </p>
